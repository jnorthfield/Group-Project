1. Install a command line tool. For mac I like [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) and for Windows development I use [cmder](http://cmder.net/).
2. Clone the repository [GitHub Cloning Instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
3. Using the command line tool navigate to the nathan-james directory

Install the angular cli, install packages, and start app.

```sh

Now as you make and save changes to the code you should see them live in the browser :)
